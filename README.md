# Smartly discover environment using IoT sensors with cloud computed machine learning

# Abstract

The machine learning domain is gaining a lot of interest in the scientific community as well
as in the industry. Various machine learning models are applied to every field where
automation is possible. The autonomous vehicle industry is growing rapidly, and the
exploring vehicle are developed for various application. With these vehicles being smaller
and smaller the computing power required by the machine learning model is not always
available on the small device. Therefore, with the rise of IoT devices it is now possible to
have smart devices computing their model on a cloud server for huge computing power. In
this project will be developed the prototype of an autonomous vehicle able to communicate
in real time like an IoT device to a cloud computing platform. The goal of this prototype will
be to map an unknown 2D environment using a 2D Lidar and a 9-axis inertial sensor. The
last part of the project wasnâ€™t fully developed but theoretically analysed and schematized.
The goal will be to create a reinforcement model, allowing the robot to learn how to
efficiently discover the unknown environment.
